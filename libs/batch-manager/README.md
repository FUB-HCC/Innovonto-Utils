# Batch Manager
This is the combination of different data collection projects I did in the context of
[Innovonto](innovonto-core.imp.fu-berlin.de/).

The projects were:
* rate similarities between idea texts
* annotate concepts within ideas
* rate ideas (novelty, value, etc)

This project needs the following functionality:

* [] create a project
* [X] allocate a batch to a worker
* [X] receive submission results and update the project state accordingly
