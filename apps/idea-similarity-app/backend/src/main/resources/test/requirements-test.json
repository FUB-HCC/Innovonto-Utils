      "content": "The way this technology can be used is by detecting the flow of people. For example in a crowded area, if we  can study the way people move, the flow of the crowd and where they go, we can design large areas to be more open. One specific place would be an airport, if we can utilize this technology and learn where people tend to walk, where people tend to gravitate to when going through an airport.  From personal experience I have seen that people tend to 'clog up' a certain area when they go through an airport. If the technology could figure out how we can design a large space, we could better prevent long lines, and too many people crowded in a space.",
